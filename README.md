# Privacy-app
Hi everyone, this project is a mobile app built for a future social media called privacy.
Everyone can contribute to that project, but remember that this app will be published to the play store, so be careful.
You can edit the files in android studio, or any other ide.
The languages I used: Kotlin and XML.
For the database, I used firebase.
